Since you're curious, please enjoy the following vague details of my life.

- I live a double life. Software developer by day, musician by night (sometimes reversed).
- I work for a software company and ride a bike.
- I choose to live where I live in spite of the weather.
- I don't tweet much, but when I do I use [@jmgozde](https://twitter.com/jmgozde).
